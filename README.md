## üìò Guide

### Before Install

Make sure your `git`, `hexo` and `Node.js` workflow is fine. Hexon only provide a GUI for these commands, but **not implement them**.

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gethexon/hexon
pnpm install
pnpm run setup
```

### Uninstall

Just remove the folder you just cloned

```bash
rm -rf hexon
```

### Start

For plain Node.js:

```bash
pnpm start
```

For better devOps with [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)

```bash
pnpm prd
# or integrate pm2 with `pnpm start` manually
```

### Update

Just uninstall the old one and install the new one.

## üíª Commands

- `pnpm run setup`: install and config
- `pnpm start`: start hexon with node
- `pnpm prd`: start hexon with pm2
- `pnpm resetpwd`: reset password
- `pnpm script`: manage custom script

You can replace hexon commands with your own bash script inside hexo blog folder.

e.g. modify `git sync` script
1. write your script in `<hexo-blog-path>/git_sync.sh`
2. run `pnpm script`
3. select `git sync` 
4. set script to `bash ./git_sync.sh`

## üñ•Ô∏è Develop

- Check out `main` branch.
- Run `pnpm dev-init` install dependencies and config hexon.
- Run `pnpm dev` and show your magic!

## üëåüèª FAQ

### 404 Error

Maybe mistakes in revert proxy config(e.g. Nginx or Apache config). To verify, use `curl` on your server directly request assets without any revert proxy. This should be a command looks like:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5777/assets/HMonacoEditor.5101bbae.js
```

Or hexon failure. Just raise an issue.
